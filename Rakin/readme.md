# Text summarizer
The project in the course for Language Engineering:

## The task
The task involves creating an automatic text summarizer, highlighting the importance of summarization for processing large texts efficiently. While early research focused on extractive summarization, which involves selecting and assembling sentences from the original text, this method often results in suboptimal summaries. The more advanced and challenging abstractive approach generates summaries from scratch. This has become feasible with the advent of neural-network-based methods.

For this task, I will use one or several pre-trained transformer models, fine-tuning them on a summarization dataset. Available datasets for this purpose include WikiHow and Amazon Fine Food Reviews, among others. The performance of the summarizer will be evaluated using established metrics like ROUGE, complemented by manual assessment.
